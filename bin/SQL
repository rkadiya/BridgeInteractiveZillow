SQL
Given the following SQL table:
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[posts](
[id] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
[user_id] [int] NOT NULL,
[date_posted] [datetime] NOT NULL,
[date_modified] [datetime] NOT NULL,
[content] [text] NOT NULL,
CONSTRAINT [PK_posts] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED ( [id] ASC )
)

Write a single query that will get the post id of the most recently modified post for each user


SOLUTION:

select id from posts join (select user_id, MAX(date_modified) as maxdate from posts group by user_id) as temp on posts.user_id=temp.user_id and posts.date_modified=temp.maxdate
